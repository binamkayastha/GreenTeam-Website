# GreenTeam Website [Cleaning Up]

Website Code is hosted on: http://binamkayastha.github.io/GreenTeam-Website/index.html

This project was created for the purpose of teaching me how to properly make responsive websites, and to serve the WPI GreenTeam with a website they can maintain with minimum knowledge of Github.

More info on how to maintain the website can be found at the github wiki page. If you are the new maintainer of the greenteam website, and would like to be gain acess to the repository as an admin, please email me at bkayastha@wpi.edu.

Unfortunately, due to various reasons, a new website has been made for the WPI GreenTeam. The new website (not created by me) is hosted here: greenteam.wpi.edu

Therefore this repository will most likely be changed into a template to be used for inspiration/design of their own websites.

Todo
 - [ ] Save current state of repository to a seperate branch
 - [ ] Change information on main branch to be a template
 - [ ] Change name of repository
