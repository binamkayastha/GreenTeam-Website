# Website Template: Green Post-It [In Progress]

Website Template Code originally made for the GreenTeam at WPI, and now has been
replaced with another website (greenteam.wpi.edu)

Website Code is hosted on: http://binamkayastha.github.io/GreenTeam-Website/index.html

This project was created for the purpose of teaching me how to properly make responsive websites, and to serve the WPI GreenTeam with a website they can maintain with minimum knowledge of Github.

Info on how to maintain the website can be found at the github wiki page.

Todo
 - [ ] Save current state of repository to a seperate branch
 - [ ] Change information on main branch to be a template
 - [ ] Change name of repository
